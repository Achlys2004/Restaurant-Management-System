# Restaurant Management System üçΩÔ∏è

This project is a full-featured Restaurant Management System designed using Database Management System (DBMS) principles and Software Engineering practices. It includes a web interface built with Streamlit to interact seamlessly with the database for streamlined restaurant operations.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run this project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **MySQL**: Install MySQL Server to create and manage the database.
3. **Streamlit**: Install Streamlit for the web-based interface.

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Restaurant-Management-System.git
   cd Restaurant-Management-System
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

3. *Set Up MySQL Database:*

   - Create a new schema named *restaurant_db*.
   - Update your database credentials (username, password, and database name) in the Python code to match your MySQL settings.
   - Execute the SQL script to set up the tables and populate any initial data:

     ```
     mysql -u your_username -p restaurant_db < restaurant_db.sql
     ```
